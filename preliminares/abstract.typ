This project develops and implements a comprehensive web-based online ordering system for Bambú Restaurant, incorporating emerging artificial intelligence technologies through Model Context Protocol (MCPs). The system addresses the challenges faced by food service establishments operating with traditional methods, which limit their reach, operational efficiency, and competitiveness in digitalized markets. The solution implements a modern technology stack based on Next.js, React, MongoDB, Stripe, and NextAuth, providing complete functionality for product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, and administrative panel. The main innovation lies in the integration of four custom MCP servers (Menu, Inventory, Orders, and Restaurant Information) that enable the assistant chatbot to access real-time data, eliminating the desynchronization characteristic of traditional chatbots with static information. The agile development methodology facilitates rapid iterations and adaptation to changing requirements. Results demonstrate significant improvements in chatbot response accuracy, user satisfaction, and operational efficiency compared to conventional systems. The project establishes a modular and scalable architecture that serves as a foundation for future expansions and contributes valuable knowledge about practical applications of MCPs in real business contexts, contributing to the technological ecosystem of digital transformation in the food service sector.
